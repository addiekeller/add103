          My journey in theatre has been an incredible experience filled with
          creativity and friendships. One of my favorite moments was during my
          senior show in high school, where I played four characters in The
          Little Mermaid. My most prominent role was Ursula, the sea witch. I
          will never forget the standing ovation we received on our closing
          night. The theatre was packed, and the emotions were overwhelming—it
          felt amazing to share that moment with my cast and audience. <br /> <br>
          Since then, I’ve continued to pursue my passion at the MCC BlackBox
          Theatre. So far, I’ve been in four shows at MCC: Heathers: The Musical,
          Juliet and Romeo (a gender-swapped version), Frankenstein, and Present
          Laughter. Each production has been a fun adventure, allowing me to
          explore different characters and stories. I have met so many wonderful
          friends and members of the theatre community along the way. Theatre
          has not only helped me grow as a performer but also connected me with
          people who share the same passion. I can’t wait to see where my
          theatre journey takes me next!
