              Sewing has been a passion of mine since I was little. When I was
              young, I often hand-sewed items, even if they weren’t the best
              quality, since I didn’t have access to a sewing machine and didn’t
              know how to use one. One Christmas, I was excited to see a product
              called “Sew Cool” that claimed to sew without thread. I was
              thrilled and didn’t bother reading the instructions, thinking I
              could figure it out like the commercials showed. Unfortunately, I
              broke it almost immediately, and I was devastated. I remember
              bawling over it because I was so excited to finally sew. Not long
              after that incident, my mom saved up and bought me a real sewing
              machine for my birthday in January. I thought it was the coolest
              gift ever! My aunt promised to help me learn how to use it, but
              life got busy, and it sat unused for years. <br /><br />
              Then came COVID-19. During the lockdown, my mom had the idea to
              make masks, and I was finally old enough to look up instructions
              to use the sewing machine myself. To my surprise, it was fairly
              simple! That experience reignited my passion for sewing and gave
              me the confidence to tackle new projects. Since then, I’ve
              completed a few fun sewing projects. <br /><br />One of my favorite projects was upcycling a pair of pants that
              were too small. I cut open the sides and added fabric to create
              stylish bellbottoms. I had so much fun with that project that I
              did the same with another pair of pants! It felt great to give
              them a new life and make something that fit me better. I’ve also
              kept up my hand stitching. Last year, around Halloween, I made a
              vampire bat and a little ghost for my boyfriend. These small
              projects are a great way to express my creativity. Sewing has
              become an important hobby for me, and I look forward to creating
              more projects in the future. Each piece I make reminds me of how
              far I’ve come from those early days of hand sewing and the joy
              that comes from making something with my own hands.
