<p >Music has always played an important role in my life, starting with dance. I began dancing at the age of 3 and continued for 17 years until I recently retired from my dance studio. It was time for me to move on and focus on school as the environment had changed. Tap has always been my favorite style, but I’ve done many styles. Additionally, during middle school, I danced competitively for my studio for four years. It was an amazing experience to perform at competitions, meet celebrities, and dance in huge ballrooms filled with other talented dancers my age. <br> <br>
In middle school, I also discovered the ukulele during a music class. The moment I touched it, I fell in love and begged my mom to get me one. I quickly became consistent and started writing songs to express my feelings, especially a few years later during the tough times of 2020 when COVID-19 kept me at home. Writing music helped me cope with my emotions. <br> <br>
In 2020, I transitioned to guitar and now play that more often. These days, I hardly touch my ukulele, but I’ve written some great songs on guitar. <br><br>In high school, I enjoyed being part of the choir, mainly in advanced choir. While I haven’t joined a community choir since graduating, I’m busy focusing on my studies and other interests.
