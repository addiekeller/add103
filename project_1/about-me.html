Here's a profile based on your information:

My name is Addie Keller, and I’m 20 years old. I am currently in my third year at McHenry County College, where I am studying graphic design. I love being creative and expressing myself through art. I plan to graduate with my associate's degree in the spring of 2025 and then transfer to the MCC University Center in Woodstock in the fall of 2025 to continue my education.
<br>
Outside of class, I enjoy participating in plays at the MCC BlackBox Theatre. Theatre has helped me make many close friends, including my boyfriend, whom I met whilst participating in a play. I also have a passion for music and writing my own songs, which lets me explore my feelings and share my thoughts with others.
<br>
In addition to my studies and theatre, I have experience in sewing, which allows me to create unique clothing and projects. I used to dance for 17 years, which taught me discipline and creativity. To support myself while studying, I work in retail, where I enjoy interacting with customers and learning new skills.

        <h2>My Pets</h2>
        <p>I have some amazing pets that bring joy to my life. My dog, Gus, is a sweet orange-colored mix that looks like a short-haired lab. He has a playful personality and always knows how to make me smile. What makes Gus even more special is that we share the same birthday! <br>
I also have a painted turtle named Edna. She mostly stays in her tank, but she has her moments of fame. Recently, I made a semi-viral TikTok video with her, joining a trend where people showcase their pets. It was so much fun, and Edna loved being the star of the show! <br>
Last year, we lost our beloved pitbull mix, April, to cancer. She was a sweetheart and brought so much love to our family. We miss her every day, and she will always have a special place in our hearts. Even though she is no longer with us, the memories we created together will last forever. Gus and Edna keep me company and help fill the space left by April’s absence. They each have their unique personalities, and I cherish the time I spend with them.
