    <p>"The Owl House" is a fantastic show that stands out for its great character development and exciting plot. Throughout the series, not just the main character Luz, but all the characters grow and change in meaningful ways. Luz starts as a curious and adventurous girl who learns to harness her magical skills to fight the evil tyrant Belos. It's interesting to note that Luz's actions with time travel actually play a role in Belos's rise to power, making her journey even more complex. <br>
        Another highlight of the show is the sweet romantic story between Luz and Amity. Their relationship is one of the first clear LGBTQ representations in Disney's children's TV, which is a big step forward in showing diversity and inclusion. Overall, "The Owl House" is a remarkable show with strong character growth and important representation that makes it a standout in kids' television.</p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p><b>Luz -</b> <br>
        Luz is the main character of the show. She is a human girl who finds herself in the witch realm on the Boiling Ilses. There, she studies witchcraft and how to do spells. Since she's human, it's trickier for her, but she finds her ways to cast spells.<br>
        <br><b>Eda the Owl Lady -</b><br>
        Eda is Luz's mentor and the person who finds here first in the Isles. She is the most powerful witch around because she refused to join a coven and seal away all but one form of her magic (something that is illegal to not conform to).<br>
       <br><b>Willow, Gus, Amity -</b><br>
        These are her friends, and Amity later becomes her girlfriend. These are the witches on the isles that she goes to school with and hangs out with, and another group that leads her through her journey on the isles and helps her take down the tyrant leader Belos.<br>
       <br> <b>Belos -</b><br>
        Belos is a human who stumbled into the witch realm after his older brother, who fell in love with a witch. Belos, also known as Philip (his human name) is a witch hunter, and eventually took power due to talk of "wild magic" destroying his family. His idea was to institute the coven system and make it so witches could only practice one form of magic for the rest of their lives. He planned to institute the "day of unity," which would kill all witches, but Luz and the gang stopped him.<br>
        <br>There are many many other characters on the show that either help or hinder the cause, but all in all the good guys win and there is in fact a happy ending.</p>

        <h3>Luz and Amity</h3>
        <p>The reason Luz and Amity finally got together was all thanks to Luz's friend Hooty. He arranged an entire romantic boat ride scene with hearts and statues. Luz was embarrassed and destroyed the whole thing, but after it was all over, Luz and Amity stood in front of one anther and finally asked each other out in the heat of the moment. It was all building up to it, and defininately mutual. <blockquote><b>Amity:</b> “You don't have to say anything. I get it. I guess I’m not very good at this.” <br>

            <b>Luz:</b> “No, wait. I do want to say something. I’ve been trying to find the right words, but... I really like you, Amity. And I’d love to go on a date with you, if you’re up for it.”<br>
            
            <b>Amity:</b> “I’d like that. A lot.”</blockquote>Their relationship continues through the rest of the show.</p>
