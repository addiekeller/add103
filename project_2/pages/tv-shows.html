          <h3>The Owl House - Disney</h3>
          <p>
            One of my all-time favorite shows is The Owl House, a Disney Channel
            cartoon that came out a few years ago. This story follows a human
            named Luz who stumbles into the Demon Realm and discovers a world
            full of magic and mystery. Luz, although human, strives to become a
            which and starts learning spells. She forms strong friendships with
            unique characters like her mentor, Eda the Owl Lady, and King, a
            tiny but mighty creature. She also meets witches her age and makes
            many other friends (and even a girlfriend) along the way. As the
            series unfolds, Luz becomes a hero, standing up to protect the
            Boiling Isles from dark forces. I watched The Owl House on my own
            first and loved it so much that I watched it again with my
            boyfriend, who enjoyed it just as much. I recommend tissues for the
            finale, it's a tear-jerker.

          <h3>Star vs. The Forces of Evil - Disney</h3>
          <p>
            Another show I love is Star vs. The Forces of Evil, an older Disney
            Channel show. This story centers around Star Butterfly, a princess
            from another dimension who lives on Earth as an exchange student.
            Star is both powerful and funny, but as the series goes on, she
            realizes that being a princess is a huge responsibility. She has to
            confront issues from her kingdom’s past and even deals with
            difficult topics like inequality and prejudice. Star’s friendship
            with Marco, her Earth friend, gets complicated too, with some ups
            and downs in her relationships with him and her ex-boyfriend, Tom.
            Star vs. The Forces of Evil mixes fantasy, humor, and real-life
            challenges in a way that's exciting to watch.

          <h3>Adventure Time - Cartoon Network</h3>
          <p>
            Adventure Time is another favorite, though it took me a while to get
            hooked. It starts off with silly, stand-alone episodes, but over
            time it reveals a deeper, complex and overarching story. The show
            follows Finn the Human and Jake the Dog as they explore the Land of
            Ooo, which is full of bizarre creatures and kingdoms. Throughout the
            show, Adventure Time introduces themes like loss, friendship, and
            even includes LGBTQ+ representation, which was rare for its time.
            After the show ended, they gave the fans some extra gifts through
            creating special episodes and even an entire spin-off series called
            Fionna and Cake, which adds new layers to the original world and
            characters. Fionna and Cake appear in the original series, but the
            amazing writers were able to make the characters part of the canon
            storyline through the spin-off on Max. It was an impressive feat.
