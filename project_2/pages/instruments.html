          The two instruments I still play today are the ukulele and the guitar. My journey with instruments began in middle
          school when I discovered the ukulele. I was instantly hooked! I begged my mom to buy me one, and once I got it, I
          couldn’t stop playing. During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I picked up the guitar, and since then, I’ve been
          writing
          songs for both instruments. Though I started with the ukulele, the guitar has become my main focus now, and it’s an
          instrument I’m really passionate about.

          Aside from the ukulele and guitar, I’ve played a few other instruments, though I didn’t stick with them for very long.
          In 5th grade music class, we were required to buy harmonicas and recorders to use in class, and while it was fun, I
          never really pursued them beyond that year. I still have those instruments, but they’re more of a memory than anything
          I
          play regularly. During that same year, I joined the 5th grade band and chose to play the flute. They told us it was
          one
          of the harder instruments, but I managed to make the right sound on my first try, so I felt like it was meant to be! I
          enjoyed playing the flute that year, but I didn’t continue with it in middle or high school. <br>
          When I got to high school, I decided to try piano and took a class for it. I was doing pretty well at first, but
          unfortunately,
          COVID-19 interrupted the semester, so I never continued. I know how to read sheet music, so I could theoretically pick
          it up again if I wanted to, but I haven’t had the motivation to go back to it.
