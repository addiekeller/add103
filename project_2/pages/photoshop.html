          My journey into digital editing started back in high school. During my
          junior year, I took an online class over Zoom that introduced me to a
          program called Photopea. Since we were learning from home during
          COVID-19, Photopea worked as a stand-in for Photoshop, which the
          school couldn’t provide. I found myself really enjoying digital
          editing and learning all the different tools. The gingerbread house
          showcased on the left is one project I completed in that class. <br />

          In my senior year, I took a photography class and used Photopea again.
          This time, I made bigger projects, diving deeper into digital image
          editing. After graduation, I put digital art on hold for a while, but
          I came back to it when I joined a play at McHenry County College. I
          wanted to make some mock ads for my social media, so I opened up
          Photopea again—and I was hooked! I kept building my skills and
          experimenting with different styles and effects. <br />

          Around that time, our director, Jay Geller, noticed my work and
          started asking me to create “Meet The Cast” posts for the MCC BlackBox
          social media pages. Working on these projects inspired me to pursue
          digital art more seriously and consider a career in graphic design.
          Now, I use Photoshop for my college classes and love working on
          creative projects whenever I can. This journey has been a lot of fun,
          and I’m excited to keep learning and improving my Photoshop skills!
