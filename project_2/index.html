          <h2>My Art Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve always been interested in different kinds of art, and I like
            trying new things! Sewing is one of my earliest hobbies. I started
            out with hand-sewing when I was little, and in 2020, I learned how
            to use a sewing machine. Since then, I've enjoyed making projects
            like upcycled clothing pieces and other fun designs. <br />
            I also love painting. Sometimes, I paint on my bedroom walls, but I
            also work on canvases and random objects. It’s a relaxing way to get
            creative, and I usually have music or a podcast playing while I
            paint. <br />
            Recently, I’ve started beading to make necklaces and bracelets. I
            mostly make them for my boyfriend, using cross-stitch thread and
            glass beads. This hobby started when I went to the Renaissance faire
            for the first time last year, and I’ve loved it ever since. <br />
            Another favorite is digital art. I’ve been into it since I took a
            digital imaging class in high school, and now I'm studying graphic
            design. I use Photoshop a lot and hope to turn this passion into a
            career. <br />
            Another medium I've dabbled in is sculpting. While I don’t sculpt much anymore, I did enjoy making clay projects in my
            high school 3D-Art class. <br />
            Lastly, I love writing music. I play
            guitar and ukulele and use Bandlab to record my songs. Music has
            been a big part of my creative journey. <br />
            Each of these arts gives me a different way to express myself, and I
            can’t wait to keep exploring them all!
