          <h3>➔ Isa</h3>
          <p>
            One of the first friends I made in college was Isa. We met in an
            Acting I class two years ago and got to work together on Heathers:
            The Musical that same semester. Working on the play and being in
            class together made us a great pair. I loved spending time with Isa
            because we could share the excitement of both rehearsals and acting
            exercises. We had a lot of fun in that first semester, and it’s
            awesome to have stayed friends.
          </p>
          <h3>➔ Emma</h3>
          <p>
            Emma is another friend from that Acting I class. We were assigned a
            scene together, and it turned out to be one of the most challenging
            scenes I’ve ever done. Working on it together brought us closer, and
            we both learned a lot. Emma has a cat named Willow, and she’s a huge
            Taylor Swift fan, which is fun because she always has new Swiftie
            updates to share.
          </p>
          <h3>➔ Skye</h3>
          <p>
            Skye is an awesome friend I met while working on Juliet and Romeo.
            He did tech work for Heathers, but we didn’t really get to know each
            other until we acted together the following semester. Skye has this
            cool, laid-back personality, and we started hanging out as a group
            with Isa and Emma. He’s a chill and supportive friend, and it’s
            always a blast hanging out with him.
          </p>
          <h3>➔ Nathan</h3>
          <p>
            Nathan is my boyfriend now, but we actually first became close
            friends during Juliet and Romeo, where he played Romeo and I played
            Countess Paris. It’s funny to look back on because he had a huge
            crush on me the whole time. Nathan is a goofball and makes
            everything more fun. He’s my boyfriend, but also my best friend,
            which is pretty special.
          </p>
          <h3>➔ Olivia</h3>
          <p>
            Olivia, or Liv, is the friend I can tell absolutely anything to. We
            have this unique bond where no topic is off-limits, and we don’t
            hold back any details. Sometimes we grab lunch just to update each
            other on life, and those conversations are always a highlight.
            Having a friend like Liv is amazing because everyone needs someone
            they can be totally open with.
          </p>
